%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

\newcommand\ANDREWID{ckingsf}     % your andrew id
\newcommand\HWNUM{1}              % the homework number
%Section B==============Put your answers to the questions below here=======================

% no need to restate the problem --- the graders know which problem is which,
% but replacing "The First Problem" with a short phrase will help you remember
% which problem this is when you read over your homeworks to study.

\question{1}{The First Problem} 

\part{a} \algorithm Describe algorithm here

\correctness This is an argument  that this algorithm returns the correct answer.

\runtime Describe here, in big-Oh, the running time and your reasoning for it.

\part{b}

\question{2}{The second problem}
