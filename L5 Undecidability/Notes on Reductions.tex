\lstset{language=Python, tabsize = 4}
Collection of mapping reductions and pseudocode that prove them.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show a reduction from $H_{TM} \leq_{M}B$, where H = $\{<M> \mid \mbox{M halts on } \epsilon\}$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Pseudo code
				\begin{lstlisting}
				def R(<M>):
					def N(x):
						if x == ``00'':
							M("")
							return Accept
						elif x == ``11'':
							return Reject
						else:
							return Reject
					return(N)
				\end{lstlisting}
		\item Commentary:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If N is in B then N accepts 00 or 11, but not both.  By construction N doesn't accept 11, so it must accept 00.  The only way it can accept 00 is when $M(\epsilon)$ either accepts or rejects.
				\item If N is not in B then it can't accept on the previous conditions: N must accept either both 00 and 11, or neither. By construction N rejects 11, which means it can't also reject 00. Again by construction N can't ever reject 00: it either accepts 00 or it loops.
